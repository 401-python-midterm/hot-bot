## Name of Project: Hot Bot

### Summary of idea: Create a crypto bot with AI.

  Monitoring crypto markets efficiently is a very time consuming investment strategy.  By creating an automated process with strong
  trading algorithms we hope to show a +5% return when processing historic data.  Should we accomplish this we will then set the bot loose

  in a test environment with fake funds but real time pricing data.



### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.

Our MVP is a crypto bot that can show an ROI > current CD rates, savings accounts, and typical prospectus 
returns in the stock exchange.

**MetaTrader is a resource that Roger recommends.  Buy and sell in a fake environment!
